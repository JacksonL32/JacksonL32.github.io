            <h2>About Colleen Black</h2>
<br/>
  <p class="about"><strong>Colleen Black</strong> is an artist truly driven by the emotion of the soul. Her earlier works are intense with realism and transfer the miraculous power of spiritual enlightenment and inner strength. Self-taught in sculpture, she is motivated by the fascinating complexity of the human form and the strength of the human spirit. Her collectors are breath-taken by the aesthetic accuracy of her sculpture and painting, but Colleen believes that the physical beauty is the byproduct of the arts true significance.

Colleen is a world renowned artist represented by various galleries throughout the United States as well as some that are in a very literal sense “overseas”. Various cruise lines that span the globe are some of Colleen’s most recent carriers of her wide variety of artistic endeavors. She is currently traveling the world making appearances for live painting demonstrations in which a model is transformed onto a canvas or into clay and the very act of spiritual enlightenment through creativity is most often witnessed in this live and very real performance.

Colleen’s work can be found in numerous private collections and selected galleries throughout the world. She studied painting in Italy at The Florence School of Art, and gives great credit to her mentor Jack Richard, a very well-known artist of soul and spirit in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. She has previously traveled to Belgium, Germany and Japan to demonstrate and exhibit her sculpture. Her commissions include completing a limited edition sculpture and oil painting for General Colin Powell as well as seven Congressional Medal of Honor recipients.

 In addition to her new book, C. Behind the Black and promises of others that are already in the works, Miss Black is currently working on a series of paintings and monumental bronzes. She is continually exploring the inner universe, the soul’s link with quantum mechanics, enlightenment, and the questions that arise to drive us into a new understanding of our creativity.

 “My goals have always been to touch some deeper side of people’s reality... to plant a seed. People can get a sense of helplessness in the face of tragedy. My hope is that this work may just open a door, or even a window, and shed some light on a new direction… a new movement… a new renaissance. There is a deeper side of existence. Something so much more beautiful than surface qualities. Look beyond what you see, and have faith that there is something more. Mustard seeds really do have the ability to move mountains.” – C. Black</p>
