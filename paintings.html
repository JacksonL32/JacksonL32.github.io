    <p class="bubble"> Intuition changes everything" 30x20 - This is my little red
 riding hood painting. Through some of the worst encounters in life
I have always been able to look back and find the signs that warned me before entering into the "deep dark woods".
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I didn't. Either way I always found more than
 I started with. In this painting the butterfly is acting as her guardian angel; popping the bubble to reveal an apparition
 of the big bad wolf and hopefully touching a side of her intuition that spurs the conscience into that all too familiar
 "uneasy feeling".</p>

      "A Golden Moment" - 20x30-  I wanted to capture the friendship
we share with our pets in this painting. A golden retriever and a
boy seemed to be the perfect concoction for the mood I was in at
the time. Sometimes my dog seems to understand me more
than I do myself.

    <p> "Beachcombers"  36x24 - Some of my favorite moments
      growing up were with my mom and brothers on the beach.
      This was painted in the midst of some very rainy/cold  days
      in Tacoma, Washington. It brought some sunshine into the
      room and leaked some on my heart.
